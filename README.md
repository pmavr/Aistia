# Aistia

### Purpose
 The application searches according to a predefined set of criteria, at regular intervals, in a real estate website for new posts of interest and sends to the user those posts that have not been encountered before, through email. For example, you are in search of home to rent and you have no time to search all those websites and every time something comes up, you realize it belatedly, losing the opportunity. The app may check every 15 minutes for new posts and sent their URLs so that you decide whether you 're interested. 

### Disclaimer
The application has been implemented for programming practice. It is not intended to be used as a means to bypass offered paid services of real estate websites, that serve the same purpose.
